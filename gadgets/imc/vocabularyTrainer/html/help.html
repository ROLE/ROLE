				<p>The Vocabulary Trainer widget is implementing a slightly modified Leitner system. 
				A vocabulary list consists of five different buckets. 
				If an item is added, it will be put in the first bucket. 
				If the user is training a list and knows the right translation, 
				the item will be moved to the next bucket, or else it will be moved to the previous bucket.</p>
				
				<p>The widget has four functionalities represented by four tabs: "Add", "List", "Train" and "Stats".</p>
				
				<p>The first view, "List", provides an overview of the stored lists and vocabulary items. 
				The user can create/delete lists and inspect the content of the different buckets. 
				Also the links to the different sources of the vocabulary items are provided.</p>
				
				<p>The "Add" view allows users to manually insert a new term/sentence, 
				the context of that term, and its source. 
				It will use the translator Web services to give translation suggestions and use Flickr to suggest pictures 
				for the term. In combination with the Language Resource Browser widget, 
				the sent term item automatically appears in the Vocabulary Trainer widget 
				together with its term, context and source.</p>
				
				<p>The third view, "Train", gives the learner the possibility to practice her stored vocabulary items. 
				After choosing a bucket that she wants to train a term from, this bucket and its context will be displayed. 
				The user can get help by viewing the source of that item, or by viewing the image to that item (if there is one).</p>
				
				<p>The fourth view, "Stats", shows statistics of the training. It displays a global score and a score for each list.</p>
